This book provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to carry out Bayesian regression in a very friendly environment. This book is designed for teaching and applied purposes at an introductory level; we present the basic theory underlying all regression models that we developed in our GUI. We also show how to implement these models using R software, carry out some applications to highlight the potential of Bayesian regression, and have theory and computational exercises. "],

In addition, we will introduce the basics of Bayesian inference based on decision theory under uncertainty, and introduce other important concepts like utility function, loss function, risk function, optimal rules, etc. "],

We will describe their main characteristics, explaining their differences, and how to implement them. We put particular attention to elicitation techniques, that is, how to transform expert knowledge into prior probabilistic statements. "],

We will introduce Importance sampling, Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings, as well as how to calculate the marginal likelihood, which most of the times does not have analytical solution. We also will have examples showing how solve them in R, as well as mathematical and computational exercises in R. "],

["bma.html", "Chapter 12 Bayesian model averaging", " Chapter 12 Bayesian model averaging We will show how to perform Bayesian model averaging. There are two issue to handle here: models space and the marginal likelihood. The former will be tackled using Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition, Occam’s window and stochastic search variable selection. The latter can be overcome using analytical solutions or Laplace approximation. We will show the theory underlying these approaches, how to perform BMA using our GUI and R for linear models: exogenous and endogenous, and non-linear models: logit, gamma and poisson. We will have also mathematical and computational exercises in R and our GUI. "],
