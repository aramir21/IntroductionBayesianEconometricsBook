# Objective and subjective Bayesian approaches {#objsub}

The Bayesian approach can be broadly classified in two schools: objective and subjective. We will describe their main characteristics, explaining their differences, and how to implement them. We put particular attention to elicitation techniques, that is, how to transform expert knowledge into prior probabilistic statements, and Empirical Bayes, which a nice link between the Bayesian and Frequentist statistical approaches, and can be a succesful approach in the Computer-age statistical inference [@efron2016computer, p.~ 35-36].
