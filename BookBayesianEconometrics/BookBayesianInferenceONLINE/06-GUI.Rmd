# Graphical user interface {#Chap5}

This chapter presents our graphical user interface (GUI) to carry out Bayesian regression analysis in a very friendly environment without any programming skills (drag and drop). Our GUI is based on an interactive web application using *shiny* [@Chang2018], and packages like *MCMCpack* [@Martin2018] and *bayesm* [@Rossi2017] from **R** software [@R2023], and is designed for teaching and applied purposes at an introductory level. In the next chapters of the second part of this book, we carry out some applications to highlight the potential of our GUI for applied researchers and practitioners.
