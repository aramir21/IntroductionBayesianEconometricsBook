# Graphical user interface {#Chap5}

This chapter presents our graphical user interface (GUI) to carry out Bayesian regression analysis in a very friendly environment without any programming skills (drag and drop). Our GUI is based on an interactive web application using *shiny* [@Chang2018], and packages like *MCMCpack* [@Martin2018] and *bayesm* [@Rossi2017] from **R** software [@R2023], and is designed for teaching and applied purposes at an introductory level. In the next chapters of the second part of this book, we carry out some applications to highlight the potential of our GUI for applied researchers and practitioners.

## Introduction {#secGUI1}

Our GUI allows performing inference using Bayesian regression analysis without requiring programming skills. The latter seems to be a significant impediment to increasing the use of the Bayesian framework [@Woodward2005;@Karabatsos2016].

There are other available graphical user interfaces for carrying out Bayesian regression analysis. *ShinyStan* [@shinystan2017] is a very flexible open source program, but users are required to have some programming skills. This is based on *Stan* software for Bayesian data analysis [@carpenter2017stan].  *BugsXLA* [@Woodward2005] is open source, but less flexible. However, users do not need to have programming skills. *Bayesian regression: Nonparametric and parametric models* [@Karabatsos2016] is a very flexible and friendly GUI that is based on *MATLAB Compiler* for a 64-bit Windows computer. Its focus is on Bayesian nonparametric regressions, and it can be thought of for users who have mastered basic parametric models, such as the ones that we show in our GUI. There are also *MATLAB toolkit*, *Stata* and *BayES*, but these are not open sources.

We developed our GUI based on an interactive web application using shiny [@Chang2018], and some libraries in *R* [@R2023]. The specific libraries and commands that are used in our GUI can be seen in the Appendix. It has ten univariate models, four multivariate, four time series models, three hierarchical longitudinal, and seven Bayesian model averaging frameworks. In addition, it gives basic summaries and diagnostics of the posterior chains, as well as the posterior chains themselves, and different plots, such as trace, autocorrelation and densities. 

In terms of its flexibility and possibilities, our GUI lies between *ShinyStan* and *BugsXLA*: users are not required to have any programming skills, but it is not as advanced as @Karabatsos2016's software. However, our GUI can be run in any operating system. Our GUI, which we call BEsmarter,^[Bayesian econometrics: Simulations, models and applications to research, teaching and encoding with responsibility.] is freely available at **https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp**; so users have access to all our code and datasets. 

Simulated and applied datasets are in the folders *DataSim*, and *DataApp* of our *GitHub* repository (see tables in the Appendix for details). The former folder also includes the files that were used to simulate different processes, so, the population parameters are available, and as a consequence these files can be used as a pedagogical tool to show some statistical properties of the inferential frameworks available in our GUI. The latter folder contains the datasets used in this book. Users should use these datasets as templates to structure their own datasets. 

There are three ways to install our GUI. The easiest way, but that requires installation of **R** and potentially a **R** code editor, is to type `shiny::runGitHub("besmarter/BSTApp", launch.browser=T)` in the **R** console or any **R** code editor and execute it.

The second option is to visit *https://posit.cloud/content/4328505*, log in or sign up for *Posit Cloud*, and access the project titled *GUIded Bayesian regression app BSTApp*. In the right-bottom window, click on the *BSTApp-master* folder under *Files*, open the *app.R* file, and finally, click the *Run App* button. However, long inactivity will cause the window to close.

The third approach, and our recommendation, is using a *Docker* image by running:

- docker pull magralo95/besmartergui:latest
- docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 magralo95/besmartergui  

in your *Command Prompt*. This creates an isolated environment for our GUI, ensuring consistent performance across systems. Note that *Docker* must be installed to deploy our GUI this way. Then users can access the app going to *127.0.0.1:3838* or *http://localhost:3838/*.

After implementing any of the three ways to run our GUI, users can see a new window where a presentation of our research team is displayed (see Figure \@ref(fig:Fig1)). In addition, the top panel in Figure \@ref(fig:Fig1) shows the class of models that can be estimated in our GUI.

```{r Fig1, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, fig.cap="Display of graphical user interface."}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Figure1.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

## Univariate models {#secGUI2}
After our GUI is deployed (see Figure \@ref(fig:Fig1)), the user should select *Univariate Models* in the top panel. Then, the Figure \@ref(fig:Fig2) is displayed, and the user can see the radio button on the left hand side that shows the specific models inside this generic class. In particular, users can see that the normal model is selected from inside the class of univariate models.

```{r Fig2, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, fig.cap="Univariate models: Specification."}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Figure2.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

Then, the right hand side panel displays a widget to upload the input dataset, which should be a \textit{csv} file with headers in the first row. Users also should select the kind of separator used in the input file: comma, semicolon, or tab (use the folders \textbf{DataSim} and \textbf{DataApp} for the input file templates). Once users upload the dataset, they can see a data preview. Range sliders help to set the number of iterations of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the amount of burn-in, and the thinning parameter can be selected as well (see next chapters of this second part of the book for technical details). After this, users should specify the equation. This can be done with the formula builder, where users can select the dependent variable, and the independent variables, and then click on the \textit{Build formula} tab. Users can see in the \textit{Main Equation} space the formula expressed in the format used by \textbf{R} software (see Main equation box in Figure \ref{fig62}, $y\sim x1+x2+x3$). Users can modify this if necessary, for instance, including higher order or interaction terms, other transformations are also allowed. This is done directly in the \textit{Main Equation} space taking into account that this extra terms should follow formula command structure.\footnote{See \textbf{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/formula}} Note that the class of univariate models includes the intercept by default, except ordered probit, where the specification has to do this explicitly, that is, ordered probit models do not admit an intercept, for \textit{identification} issues (see details below).\footnote{An \textit{identification} issue means that multiple values for the model parameters give rise to the same value for the likelihood function.} Hence, users should write down specifically this fact ($y\sim x1+x2+x3-1$). Finally, users should define the hyperparameters of the prior; for instance, in the normal-inverse gamma model, these are the mean vector, covariance matrix, shape, and scale parameters (see Figure \ref{fig63}). However, users should take into account that our GUI has \textit{non-informative} hyperparameters by default in all our modelling frameworks, so the last part is not a requirement.

	\caption[List of figure caption goes here]{Univariate models: Results.}\label{fig63}
\end{figure}

After this specification process, users should click the \textit{Go!} button to initiate the estimation. Our GUI displays the summary statistics and convergence diagnostics after this process is finished (see Figure \ref{fig63}). There are also widgets to download posterior chains (\textit{csv} file) and graphs (\textit{pdf} and \textit{eps} files). Note that the order of the coefficients in the results (summary, posterior chains, and graphs) is first for the location parameters, and then for the scale parameters.

Multinomial models (probit and logit) require a dataset file to have in the first column the dependent variable, then alternative specific regressors (for instance alternatives' prices), and finally, non-alternative regressors (for instance, income). The formula builder specifies the dependent variable, and independent variables that are alternative specific and non-alternative specific (see technical details in next chapter). Specification also requires defining the base category, number of alternatives (this is also required in ordered probit), number of alternative specific regressors, and number of non-alternative regressors (see Figure \ref{fig64}). Multinomial logit also allows defining a tuning parameter, the number of degrees of freedom in this case, for the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm (see technical details in next chapter). This is a feature in our GUI when the estimation of the models is based on the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. The order of the coefficients in the results of these models is first the intercepts (cte$_l$ appearing in the summary display, $l$-th alternative), and then the non-alternative specific regressors (NAS$_{jl}$ appearing in the summary display, $l$-th alternative and $j$-th non-alternative regressor), and lastly, the coefficients for the alternative specific regressors (AS$_{j}$ appearing in the summary display, $j$-th alternative specific regressor). Note that the non-alternative specific regressors associated with the base category are equal to zero (they do not appear in the results). In addition, some coefficients of the main diagonal of the covariance matrix are constant due to identification issues in multinomial and multivariate probit models.

\end{figure}

In the case of the negative binomial model, users should set a dispersion parameter (see the negative binomial model in the next chapter). User should also set the censorship points and quantiles in the Tobit and quantile models, respectively.

Bayesian bootstrap only requires uploading a dataset, specifying the number of iterations of the MCMC, the resampling size, and the equation (see Figure \ref{fig65}).
The input file has the same structure as the file used in the univariate normal model.
