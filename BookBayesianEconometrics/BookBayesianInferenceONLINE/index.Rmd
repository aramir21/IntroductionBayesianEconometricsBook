Since the late 90s, Bayesian inference has gained significant popularity among researchers due to the computational revolution and the availability of algorithms to solve complex integrals. However, many researchers, students, and practitioners still lack a deep understanding and practical application of this inferential approach. The primary reason for this is the requirement for strong programming skills.

**Introduction to Bayesian Econometrics: A GUIded Toolkit using R** mainly targets those who want to apply Bayesian inference with a solid conceptual and formal understanding but may not have the time to develop programming skills.  

Thus, this book provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing Bayesian regression in a user-friendly environment. It also offers the basic theory and its code implementation using **R** software (R Core Team, 2021), along with applications that highlight the potential of Bayesian inference.  

Additionally, the book includes theoretical and computational exercises for those interested in developing more complex models. In particular, the first part presents step-by-step mathematical proofs of basic models, serving as the foundation for deriving key mathematical results in the more complex models covered in the second and third parts.

Our GUI is based on an interactive web application using `shiny` (Chang et al., 2018), along with several packages in **R**. Users can estimate univariate, multivariate, time series, longitudinal/panel data, and Bayesian model averaging models using our GUI.  

In addition, it provides basic summaries, as well as formal and graphical diagnostics of the posterior chains. Our GUI can be run on any operating system and is freely available at **[GitHub](https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp)**.

Users can access simulated and real datasets in the folders **DataSim** and **DataApp**, respectively. The **DataSim** folder also includes the files used to simulate different processes, providing access to population parameters. As a result, these files serve as a pedagogical tool for demonstrating various statistical properties. The **DataApp** folder contains the datasets used in our applications, which users are encouraged to use as templates for structuring their own datasets.  

This book is divided into three parts:  

1. **Part One** (Chapters 1–4) covers theoretical concepts, mathematical foundations, programming, and simulation.  
2. **Part Two** (Chapters 5–10) focuses on regression applications, with an emphasis on computational methods for obtaining posterior draws at three levels of programming skills:  
   - No programming skills required (using our GUI).  
   - Intermediate skills (using specialized **R** packages for Bayesian inference).  
   - Advanced skills (coding posterior draws from scratch).  
3. **Part Three** (Chapters 11–14) introduces advanced methods in Bayesian inference.  

Some mathematical derivations are presented in detail in the first part of the book, while most proofs are omitted in the second and third parts. However, the mathematical steps covered in Part One can be applied to derive results in Parts Two and Three.

In the first part, Chapter 1 introduces fundamental concepts in Bayesian inference, starting with Bayes' rule, its components, formal definitions, and basic examples. It then presents the basics of Bayesian inference within a decision-theoretic framework under uncertainty.  

Chapter 2 discusses the conceptual differences between Bayesian and Frequentist statistical approaches, providing both a historical and philosophical perspective on Bayesian statistics and econometrics while highlighting contrasts with the Frequentist approach.  

Chapter 3 introduces conjugate families in basic statistical models, solving them both analytically and computationally. Chapter 4 presents simulation-based methods, which are essential in modern Bayesian inference since most realistic models lack standard forms or analytical solutions.  

In the second part, Chapter 5 introduces our graphical user interface (GUI). Univariate and multivariate regression models are covered in Chapters 6 and 7. Chapter 8 focuses on univariate and multivariate time series models, while Chapter 9 covers Bayesian longitudinal/panel data models. Chapter 10 introduces Bayesian model averaging.  

The third part covers advanced topics:  
- Chapter 11 explores semi-parametric and non-parametric models.  
- Chapter 12 discusses Bayesian methods in machine learning.   
- Chapter 13 covers causal inference.   
- Chapter 14 describes approximation methods.  

**About Me**

My name is **Andrés Ramírez-Hassan**, and I am an applied and theoretical econometrician working as a Distinguished Professor in the School of Finance, Economics, and Government at *Universidad EAFIT* (Medellín, Colombia). I hold a **PhD in Statistical Science**, a **Master's degree in Finance**, a **Master's degree in Economics**, and a **Bachelor's degree in Economics**. I have been a research fellow at the *Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University* and a visiting professor in the *Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne and the University of Glasgow*.  

Since completing my PhD, my research has primarily focused on **Bayesian econometrics**, with applications in crime, finance, health, sports, and utilities. My work has been published (or is forthcoming) in highly regarded journals, including: *International Journal of Forecasting*, *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, *Econometric Reviews*, *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, *The R Journal*, *Economic Modelling*, *Spatial Economic Analysis*, *Economic Inquiry*, *World Development*, *Journal of Sport Economics*, *Empirical Economics*, *Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics*, *Brazilian Journal of Probability and Statistics*, among other prestigious international research outlets.

I founded **BEsmarter** — *Bayesian Econometrics: simulations, models, and applications to research, teaching, and encoding with responsibility*. This research group’s **mission** is to *lead and excel in generating and disseminating Bayesian econometric knowledge through research, teaching, and software*. Our **vision** is to advance worldwide econometric research, teaching, and applications based on the Bayesian framework, aiming to:

- Inspire new econometric ideas
- Create a user-friendly environment for Bayesian econometrics applications
- Transform classical econometric research, teaching, and applications
- Address critical social problems through scientific advancements

# Preface {-}

The main goal of this book is to make the Bayesian inferential framework more approachable to students, researchers, and practitioners who wish to understand and apply this statistical/econometric approach but do not have the time to develop programming skills. I have aimed to strike a balance between applicability and theory. This book provides a very user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the most common regression models, while also covering the basic mathematical developments and their code implementation for those interested in advancing to more complex models.

## To instructors and students {-}

This book is divided into three parts: foundations (chapters 1 to 4), regression analysis (chapters 5 to 10), and *Advanced* methods (chapters 11 to 14). Our graphical user interface (GUI) is designed for the second part. The source code can be found at **[https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp](https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp)**. Instructors and students can access all the code, along with simulated and real datasets. There are three ways to install our GUI:

1. Type `shiny::runGitHub("besmarter/BSTApp", launch.browser=T)` in the **R** console or any **R** code editor and execute it.
2. Visit **[https://posit.cloud/content/4328505](https://posit.cloud/content/4328505)**, log in or sign up for **Posit Cloud**, navigate to the **BSTApp-master** folder in the **Files** tab of the right-bottom window, then click on the **app.R** file and select **Run App**.
3. Use a **Docker** image by typing in the **Command Prompt**:

- `docker pull magralo95/besmartergui:latest`
- `docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 magralo95/besmartergui`

Then users can access our GUI by going to **http://localhost:3838/**. See Chapter \@ref(Chap5) for details.

Students should have a basic understanding of probability theory and statistics, as well as some background in econometrics and time series, particularly regression analysis. Familiarity with standard univariate and multivariate probability distributions is strongly recommended. See a nice summary of useful probability distributions in [@greenberg2012introduction].

Additionally, students who wish to master the material in this book should have programming skills in **R** software. [An excellent starting point for **R** programming is the *R Introduction Manual*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf).

I have included both formal and computational exercises at the end of each chapter to help students develop a deeper understanding of the material. A solutions manual for these exercises accompanies the book.

Instructors can use this book as a textbook for a course on introductory Bayesian Econometrics/Statistics, with a strong emphasis on implementation and applications. This book is intended to be complementary, rather than a substitute, for excellent resources on the topic, such as @gelman2021bayesian, @chan2019bayesian, @rossi2012bayesian, @greenberg2012introduction, @geweke2005contemporary, @lancaster2004introduction, and @koop2003bayesian.

## Acknowledgments {-}

I began developing our graphical user interface (GUI) in 2016, after being diagnosed with cervical dystonia. I worked on this side project during weekends, which I called ``nerd weekends,'' and it served as a form of release from my health condition. Once I began to recover, I invited Mateo Graciano, my former student, business partner, and friend, to join the project. He has been instrumental in developing our GUI, and I am enormously grateful to him. 

I would also like to thank the members of the BEsmarter research group at Universidad EAFIT, as well as the NUMBATs members at Monash University, for their valuable feedback and recommendations to improve our GUI.

This book is an extension of the paper \textit{A GUIded tour of Bayesian regression} [@Ramirez2020], which serves as a brief user guide for our GUI. I decided to write this book to explain the underlying theory and code in our GUI, and to use it as a textbook in my course on Bayesian econometrics/statistics. I am grateful to my students in this course; their insights and thoughtful questions have deepened my understanding of the material.

I also thank Chris Parmeter for his suggestions on how to present our user guide, Professor Raul Pericchi and Juan Carlos Correa for introducing me to Bayesian statistics, and Liana Jacobi, Tomasz Wozniak and Chun Fung Kwok (Jackson) from the University of Melbourne, as well as David Frazier from Monash University, for engaging talks and amazing collaborations in Bayesian econometrics/statistics. My sincere gratitude goes to Professor Peter Diggle for his unwavering support of my career, and especially to Professor Gael Martin, who gave me the opportunity to work with her, she is a constant source of intellectual inspiration.

Finally, I would like to express my thanks to my colleagues and staff at Universidad EAFIT for their continuous support.

To my parents, Orlando and Nancy, who have always been there for me with their unconditional support. They have taught me that the primary aspect of human spiritual evolution is humility, a lesson I am still learning every day. To my fiancée, Estephania, for her unwavering love and support.
