# Simulation methods {#Chap4}

Simulation methods are very important in modern Bayesian inference. We will introduce Importance sampling, Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings, as well as how to calculate the marginal likelihood, which most of the times does not have analytically solution. We also will have examples showing how solve them in R, as well as mathematical and computational exercises in R.
