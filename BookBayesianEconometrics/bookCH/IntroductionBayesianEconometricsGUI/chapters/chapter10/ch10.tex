\section{Foundation}\label{sec10_1}
Remember from Chapter \ref{chap1} that Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is an approach which takes into account model uncertainty. In particular, we consider uncertainty in the regressors (variable selection) in a regression framework where there are $K$ possible explanatory variables. This implies $2^K$ potential models indexed by parameters $\bm{\theta}_m$, $m=1,2,\dots,2^K$.

Following \cite{Simmons2010}, the posterior model probability is
\begin{equation*}
	\pi(\mathcal{M}_j |\bm{y})=\frac{p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_j)\pi(\mathcal{M}_j)}{\sum_{m=1}^{2^K}p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_m)\pi(\mathcal{M}_m)},
\end{equation*}
where $\pi(\mathcal{M}_j)$ is the prior model probability,\footnote{We attach equal prior probabilities to each model in our GUI. However, this choice gives more prior probability to the set of models of medium size (think about the $k$-th row of Pascal's triangle). An interesting alternative is to use the Beta-Binomial prior proposed by \cite{ley2009effect}.} 
\begin{equation*}
	p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_j)=\int_{\bm{\Theta}_j} p(\bm{y}| \bm{\theta}_j,\mathcal{M}_j)\pi(\bm{\theta}_j | \mathcal{M}_j) d\bm{\theta}_{j}
\end{equation*}
is the marginal likelihood, and $\pi(\bm{\theta}_j | \mathcal{M}_j)$ is the prior distribution of $\bm{\theta}_j$ conditional on model $\mathcal{M}_j$.

Following \cite{Raftery93}, the posterior distribution of $\bm{\theta}$ is 
\begin{equation*}
	\pi(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y})= \sum_{m=1}^{2^K}\pi(\bm{\theta}_m|\bm{y},\mathcal{M}_m) \pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y})
\end{equation*}
where $\pi(\bm{\theta}_m|\bm{y},\mathcal{M}_m)$ is the posterior distribution of $\bm{\theta}$ under model $\mathcal{M}_m$, $\mathbb{E}[\bm{\theta}|\bm{y}]=\sum_{m=1}^{2^K}\hat{\bm{\theta}}_m \pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y})$, $Var({\theta}_{km}|\bm{y})= \sum_{m=1}^{2^K}\pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y}) \widehat{Var} ({\theta}_{km}|\bm{y},\mathcal{M}_m)+\sum_{m=1}^{2^K} \pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y}) (\hat{{\theta}}_{km}-\mathbb{E}[{\theta}_{km}|\bm{y}])^2$, $\hat{\bm{\theta}}_m$ is the posterior mean and $\widehat{Var}({\theta}_{km}|\bm{y},\mathcal{M}_m)$ is the posterior variance of the element $k$-th of $\bm{\theta}$ under model $\mathcal{M}_m$.

The posterior variance highlights how the BMA method takes into account
model uncertainty. The first term is the weighted variance of each model, averaged over all potential models, and the second term indicates how stable the estimates are across models. The more the estimates differ between models, the greater is the posterior variance.

The posterior predictive distribution is
\begin{equation*}
	\pi(\bm{Y}_0|\bm{y})= \sum_{m=1}^{2^K}p_m(\bm{Y}_0|\bm{y},\mathcal{M}_m) \pi(M_m|\bm{y})
\end{equation*}

where $p_m(\bm{Y}_0|\bm{y},\mathcal{M}_m)=\int_{\bm{\Theta}_m} p(\bm{Y}_0|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}_m,\mathcal{M}_m)\pi(\bm{\theta}_m |\bm{y}, \mathcal{M}_m) d\bm{\theta}_{m}$ is the posterior predictive distribution under model $\mathcal{M}_m$. 

Another important statistic in BMA is the posterior inclusion probability associated with variable $\bm{x}_k$, $k=1,2,\dots,K$, which is

\begin{equation*}
	PIP(\bm{x}_k)=\sum_{m=1}^{2^K}\pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y})\times \mathbbm{1}_{k,m},
\end{equation*}
where
$\mathbbm{1}_{k,m}= \left\{ \begin{array}{lcc}
	1&   if  & \bm{x}_{k}\in \mathcal{M}_m \\
	\\ 0 &  if & \bm{x}_{k}\not \in \mathcal{M}_m
\end{array}
\right\}.$\\

\cite{Kass1995} suggest that posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP) less than 0.5 are evidence against the regressor, $0.5\leq PIP<0.75$ is weak evidence, $0.75\leq PIP<0.95$ is positive evidence, $0.95\leq PIP<0.99$ is strong evidence, and $PIP\geq 0.99$ is very strong evidence.

There are two main computational issues in implementing BMA. First, the number of models in the model space is $2^K$, which sometimes can be enormous, and second, the marginal likelihood $p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_j)=\int_{\bm{\Theta}_j} p(\bm{y}| \bm{\theta}_j,\mathcal{M}_j)\pi(\bm{\theta}_j | \mathcal{M}_j) d\bm{\theta}_{j}$ most of the time does not have an analytic solution. 

The first computational issue is basically a problem of ranking models. This can be tackled using different approaches, such as Occam's window criterion \cite{Madigan1994,Raftery1997}, reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation \cite{Green1995}, Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition \cite{madigan95}, and multiple testing using intrinsic priors \cite{Casella2006} or nonlocal prior densities \cite{Johnson2012}. We focus on Occam's window and Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition in our GUI.\footnote{Variable selection (model selection or regularization) is a topic related to model uncertainty. Approaches such as stochastic search variable selection (spike and slab) \cite{George1993,George1997} and Bayesian Lasso \cite{Park2008} are good examples of how to tackle this issue. See Chapter \ref{chap13}.}

In Occam's window, a model is discarded if its predictive performance is much worse than that of the best model  \cite{Madigan1994,Raftery1997}.
Thus, models not belonging to $\mathcal{M}'=\left\{\mathcal{M}_j:\frac{\max_m {\pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y})}}{\pi(\mathcal{M}_j|\bm{y})}\leq c\right\}$ should be discarded, where $c$ is chosen by the user (\cite{Madigan1994} propose $c=20$).
In addition, complicated models than are less supported by the data than simpler models are also discarded, that is, $\mathcal{M}''=\left\{\mathcal{M}_j:\exists \mathcal{M}_m\in\mathcal{M}',\mathcal{M}_m\subset \mathcal{M}_j,\frac{\pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y})}{\pi(\mathcal{M}_j|\bm{y})}>1\right\}$. Then, the set of models used in BMA is $\mathcal{M}^*=\mathcal{M}'\cap \mathcal{M}''^c\in\mathcal{M}$. \cite{Raftery1997} find that the number of models in $\mathcal{M}^*$ is normally less than 25.

However, the previous theoretical framework requires finding the model with the maximum a posteriori model probability ($\max_m {\pi(\mathcal{M}_m|\bm{y})}$), which implies calculating all possible models in $\mathcal{M}$. This is computationally burdensome. Hence, a heuristic approach is proposed by \cite{Raftery2012} based on ideas of \cite{Madigan1994}. The search strategy is based on a series of nested comparisons of ratios of posterior model probabilities. Let $\mathcal{M}_0$ be a model with one regressor less than model $\mathcal{M}_1$, then:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $\log(\pi(\mathcal{M}_0|\bm{y})/\pi(\mathcal{M}_1|\bm{y}))>\log(O_R)$, then $\mathcal{M}_1$ is rejected and $\mathcal{M}_0$ is considered.
	\item If $\log(\pi(\mathcal{M}_0|\bm{y})/\pi(\mathcal{M}_1|\bm{y}))\leq -\log(O_L)$, then $\mathcal{M}_0$ is rejected, and $\mathcal{M}_1$ is considered.
	 \item If $\log(O_L)<\log(\pi(\mathcal{M}_0|\bm{y})/\pi(\mathcal{M}_1|\bm{y}))\leq \log(O_R$), $\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\mathcal{M}_1$ are considered.
\end{itemize} 
Here $O_R$ is a number specifying the maximum ratio for excluding models in Occam's window, and $O_L=1/O_R^{2}$ is defined by default in \cite{Raftery2012}. The search strategy can be ``up,'' adding one regressor, or ``down,'' dropping one regressor (see \cite{Madigan1994} for details about the down and up algorithms). The leaps and bounds algorithm \cite{Furnival1974} is implemented to improve the computational efficiency of this search strategy \cite{Raftery2012}. Once the set of potentially acceptable models is defined, we discard all the models that are not in $\mathcal{M}'$, and the models that are in $\mathcal{M}''$ where 1 is replaced by $\exp\left\{O_R\right\}$ due to the leaps and bounds algorithm giving an approximation to BIC, so as to ensure that no good models are discarded.

The second approach that we consider in our GUI to tackle the model space size issue is Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition (MC3) \cite{madigan1995bayesian1}.
In particular, given the space of models $\mathcal{M}_m$, we simulate a chain of $\mathcal{M}_s$ models, $s = 1, 2, ..., S<<2^K$, where the algorithm randomly extracts a candidate model $\mathcal{M}_c$ from a neighborhood of models ($nbd(\mathcal{M}_m)$) that consists of the actual model itself and the set of models with either one variable more or one variable less \cite{Raftery1997}. Therefore, there is a transition kernel in the space of models $q(\mathcal{M}_m\rightarrow \mathcal{M}_c)$, such that $q(\mathcal{M}_m\rightarrow \mathcal{M}_{c})=0 \ \forall \mathcal{M}_{c}\notin nbd(\mathcal{M}_m)$ and $q(\mathcal{M}_m\rightarrow \mathcal{M}_{c})=\frac{1}{|nbd(\mathcal{M}_m)|} \ \forall \mathcal{M}_m\in nbd(\mathcal{M}_m)$, $|nbd(\mathcal{M}_m)|$ being the number of neighbors of $\mathcal{M}_m$. This candidate model is accepted with probability

\begin{equation*}
	\alpha (\mathcal{M}_{s-1},\mathcal{M}_{c})=\min \bigg \{ \frac{|nbd(\mathcal{M}_m)|p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_c)\pi(\mathcal{M}_c)}{|nbd(\mathcal{M}^{c})|p(\bm{y}| \mathcal{M}_{(s-1)})\pi(\mathcal{M}_{(s-1)})},1 \bigg \}.
\end{equation*}

Observe that by construction $|nbd(\mathcal{M}_m)|=|nbd(\mathcal{M}_c)|=k$, except in extreme cases where a model has only one regressor or has all regressors.

The Bayesian information criterion is a possible solution for the second computational issue in BMA, that is, calculating the marginal likelihood when there is no an analytic solution. Defining $h(\bm{\theta}|\mathcal{M}_j)=-\frac{\log(p(\bm{y}| \bm{\theta}_j,\mathcal{M}_j)\pi(\bm{\theta}_j | \mathcal{M}_j))}{N}$, then $p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_j)=\int_{\bm{\Theta}_j} \exp\left\{-N h(\bm{\theta}|\mathcal{M}_j)\right\}  d\bm{\theta}_{j}$. If $N$ is sufficiently large (technically $N\to \infty$), we can make the following assumptions \cite{Hoeting1999}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We can use the Laplace method for approximating integrals \cite{Tierney1986}.
	\item The posterior mode is reached at the same point as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), denoted by $\hat{\bm{\theta}}_{MLE}$.
\end{itemize}

We get the following results under these assumptions:
\begin{align*}
	p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_j)\approx&\left( \frac{2\pi}{N}\right)^{K_j/2}|\bm{\Sigma}|^{-1/2} \exp\left\{-N h(\bm{\hat{\theta}}_j^{MLE}|\mathcal{M}_j)\right\}, \ N\rightarrow\infty,
\end{align*}
where $\bm{\Sigma}$ is the Hessian matrix of $h(\bm{\hat{\theta}}_j^{MLE}|\mathcal{M}_j)$, and $K_j=dim\left\{\bm{\theta}_j\right\}$.

This implies
\begin{align*}
	\log\left(p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_j)\right)\approx& \frac{K_j}{2}\log(2\pi)- \frac{K_j}{2}\log(N) -\frac{1}{2}\log(|\bm{\Sigma}|) + \log(p(\bm{y}| \bm{\hat{\theta}}_j^{MLE},\mathcal{M}_j))\\
	&+\log(\pi(\bm{\hat{\theta}}_j^{MLE} | \mathcal{M}_j)), \ N\rightarrow\infty.
\end{align*}

Since $\frac{K_j}{2}\log(2\pi)$ and $\log(\pi(\bm{\hat{\theta}}_j^{MLE} | \mathcal{M}_j))$ are constants as functions of $\bm{y}$, and $|\bm{\Sigma}|$ is bounded by a finite constant, we have
\begin{align*}
	log\left(p(\bm{y} | \mathcal{M}_j)\right)\approx& -\frac{K_j}{2}\log(N)+\log(p(\bm{y}| \bm{\hat{\theta}}_j^{MLE},\mathcal{M}_j))= -\frac{BIC}{2}, \ N \rightarrow \infty.
\end{align*}

The marginal likelihood thus asymptotically converges to a linear transformation of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), significantly simplifying its calculation.

\section{The Gaussian linear model}\label{sec10_2}

The Gaussian linear model specifies $\bf{y}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}+\bm{\mu}$ such that $\bm{\mu}\sim{N}(\bm{0},\sigma^2\bm{I}_n)$, and the conjugate priors for the parameters are $\bm{\beta}|\sigma^2 \sim {N}(\bm{\beta}_0, \sigma^2 \bm{B}_0)$ and $\sigma^2 \sim {I}{G}(\alpha_0/2, \delta_0/2)$ (see Section \ref{sec43}).
Given the likelihood function, $p(\bm{\beta}, \sigma^2|\bm{y}, \bm{X}) = (2\pi\sigma^2)^{-\frac{N}{2}} \exp \left\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (\bm{y} - \bm{X\beta})^{\top}(\bm{y} - \bm{X\beta}) \right\}$, we show in Section \ref{sec43} that the marginal likelihood is given by 
\begin{equation*}
	p(\bm{y}|\mathcal{M}_m)= \frac{1}{\pi^{N/2}}\frac{\delta_{m0}^{\alpha_{m0}/2}}{\delta_{mn}^{\alpha_{mn}/2}}\frac{|{\bf{B}}_{mn}|^{1/2}}{|{\bf{B}}_{m0}|^{1/2}}\frac{\Gamma(\alpha_{mn}/2)}{\Gamma(\alpha_{m0}/2)}
\end{equation*}
where all parameter are indexed to model $\mathcal{M}_m$, that is, $\alpha_{mn}=\alpha_{m0}+N$, $\delta_{mn}=\delta_{m0} + {\bf{y}}^{\top}{\bf{y}} + \bm{\beta}_{m0}^{\top}{\bf{B}}_{m0}^{-1}\bm{\beta}_{m0} - \bm{\beta}_{mn}^{\top}{\bf{B}}_{mn}^{-1}\bm{\beta}_{mn}$, $\bm{B}_{mn}=({\bf{B}}_{m0}^{-1} + {\bf{X}}^{\top}_m{\bf{X}}_m)^{-1}$, and $\bm{\beta}_{mn} = {{\bf{B}}}_{mn}({\bf{B}}_{m0}^{-1}\bm{\beta}_{m0} + {\bf{X}}^{\top}_m{\bf{X}}_m\hat{\bm{\beta}}_m)$, $\hat{\bm{\beta}}_m$ is the maximum likelihood estimator.

We implement three approaches to perform BMA in the Gaussian linear model: the BIC approximation using the Occam's window approach, the MC3 algorithm using the analytical expression for calculating the marginal likelihood, and an instrumental variable approach.

\subsection{The BIC using the Occam's window}\label{sec10_21}

We can show that the Bayesian information criterion is $N\log(\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i-\bm{x}_{mi}^{\top}\hat{\bm{\beta}}_m)^2/N)+K_m\log(N)$ in the particular case of the Gaussian linear model (see Exercise 1). Thus, we use this approximation with the Occam's window approach to decrease the computational burden of Bayesian model averaging.\\

\textbf{Example: Simulation exercise}
Let's perform a simulation exercise to assess the performance of this approximation approach in a model where the computational burden is low and we know the data generating process.

\textbf{Determinants of export diversification I}


\subsection{The Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition}\label{sec10_22}
The second approach that we implement in our GUI is using the Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition (MC3) using the analytical expression of the marginal likelihood of the Gaussian linear model.\\

\textbf{Example: Simulation exercise}
Let's perform the same simulation exercise of the previous section to assess the performance of this approach. 

\textbf{Determinants of export diversification II}

\subsection{Instrumental variable }\label{sec10_23}

We also implement the instrumental variable approach of Section \ref{sec73} to tackle potential endogeneity issues in BMA. We assume that $\bm{\gamma}\sim {N}(\bm{0},\bm{I})$, $\bm{\beta}\sim {N}(\bm{0},\bm{I})$, and $\bm{\Sigma}^{-1} \sim {W}(3,\bm{I})$ \cite{Karl2012}.

\cite{Lenkoski2013} propose an algorithm based on conditional Bayes factors \cite{Dickey1978} that allows embedding MC3 within a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Given the candidate ($M_{c}^{2nd}$) and actual ($M_{s-1}^{2nd}$) models for the iteration $s$ in the second stage, the conditional Bayes factor is 
\begin{equation*}
	CBF^{2nd}=\frac{p(\bm{y}|M_{c}^{2nd},\bm{\gamma},\bm{\Sigma})}{p(\bm{y}|M_{s-1}^{2nd},\bm{\gamma},\bm{\Sigma})},
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{equation*}
	p(\bm{y}|M_{c}^{2nd},\bm{\gamma},\bm{\Sigma})=\int_{\mathcal{M}^{2nd}}p(\bm{y}|\bm{\beta},\bm{\gamma},\bm{\Sigma})\pi(\bm{\beta}|M_{c}^{2nd})d\bm{\beta}\propto |\bm{B}_n|^{1/2} \exp\left\{\frac{1}{2}{\bm{\beta}_n}^{\top}\bm{B}_n^{-1}\bm{\beta}_n\right\}
	.
\end{equation*}

In the first stage,
\begin{equation*}
	CBF^{1st}=\frac{p(\bm{y}|M_{c}^{1st},\bm{\beta},\bm{\Sigma})}{p(\bm{y}|M_{s-1}^{1st},\bm{\beta},\bm{\Sigma})},
\end{equation*}
where \begin{equation*}
	p(\bm{y}|M_{c}^{1st},\bm{\beta},\bm{\Sigma})=\int_{\mathcal{M}^{1st}}p(\bm{y}|\bm{\gamma},\bm{\beta},\bm{\Sigma})\pi(\bm{\gamma}|M_{c}^{1st})d\bm{\gamma}\propto |\bm{G}_n|^{1/2} \exp\left\{\frac{1}{2}{\bm{\gamma}_n}^{\top}\bm{G}_n^{-1}\bm{\gamma}_n\right\}.
\end{equation*}
In the case that $\beta_k=0$, the update is based on the seemingly unrelated regressions framework. These conditional Bayes factors assume $\pi(M^{1st},M^{2sd})\propto 1$. See \cite{Lenkoski2013} for more details of the instrumental variable BMA algorithm.\footnote{\cite{Koop12} and \cite{Lenkoski2014} propose other frameworks for BMA taking into account endogeneity.}\\

\textbf{Example: Simulation exercise}
Let's perform the simulation exercise of Subsections \ref{sec10_21} and \ref{sec10_21} but introducing endogeneity. 

\textbf{Determinants of export diversification III} 


The Gaussian linear model is an example of a generalized linear model.
A GLM is characterized by a distribution function that is in the exponential family, that is, $p_i(y_i|\theta_i,\phi)=h(y_i,\phi)Exp\left\{(\theta_iy_i-b(\theta_i))/a(\phi)\right\}$ (canonical representation), $y_i\stackrel{i.n.d.} {\thicksim}p_i$, $i=1,2,\dots,n$.
It also has a linear predictor $\theta_i=\bm{x}_i^{\top}\bm{\beta}$, and a link function $g$ such that $E(Y_i|x_i)\equiv \mu_i=b'(\theta_i)=g^{-1}(\bm{x}_i^{\top}\bm{\beta})$ ($g$ is monotonic and differentiable), and $V(Y_i)=b''(\theta_i)a(\phi)$ \cite{McCullagh1989}.
The identity function $\mu_i=\bm{x}_i^{\top}\bm{\beta}$ is the canonical link function in the case of the Gaussian model.\footnote{A canonical link functions is characterized by the existence of a sufficient statistic ($\bm{X}^{\top}\bm{y}$) equal in dimension to $\bm{\beta}$.} This statistical framework can help us to characterize:

\section{The logit model}\label{sec10_3}

The logit model is also a GLM, where the link function is $\bm{x}_i^{\top}\bm{\beta}=log\left(\frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i}\right)$.
We carry out BMA using the BIC approximation and the Occam's window approach in the logit model.

\section{The gamma model}\label{sec10_4}
The gamma model is also a GLM, where the link function is $\bm{x}_i^{\top}\bm{\beta}=\mu_i^{-1}$.
We carry out BMA using the BIC approximation and the Occam's window approach in the gamma model.

\section{The Poisson model}\label{sec10_5}
The logit model is also a GLM, where the link function is $\bm{x}_i^{\top}\bm{\beta}=\log(\mu_i)$.
We carry out BMA using the BIC approximation and the Occam's window approach in the Poisson model.


\section{Calculating the marginal likelihood}\label{sec10_6}

The BIC approximation to the marginal likelihood is an asymptotic approximation. This implies limitations. Thus, there are other strategies that can be used to calculate the marginal likelihood when there is no analytic solution.
