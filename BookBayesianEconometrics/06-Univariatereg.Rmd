# Univariate regression {#unireg}

We will describe how to perform Bayesian inference in univariate models: normal-inverse gamma, logit, probit, multinomial probit and logit, ordered probit, negative binomial, tobit, quantile regression, and Bayesian bootstrap in linear models. We show their formal framework, some applications, and how to perform inference using our GUI as well as R. We will also have mathematical and computational exercises in our GUI and in R.
