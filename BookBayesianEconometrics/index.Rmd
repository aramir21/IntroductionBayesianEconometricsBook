Since late 90’s Bayesian inference has gained a lot of popularity among researchers due to the computational revolution and availability of algorithms to solve complex integrals. However, many students and practitioners still lack understanding and application of this inferential approach. The main reason is the requirement of good programming skills.

**Introduction to Bayesian econometrics: A GUIded tour** is aimed at those who want to apply Bayesian regression analysis having good theory understanding, but not having time to develop programming skills. This book provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to carry out Bayesian regression in a very friendly environment.

This book is designed for teaching and applied purposes at an introductory level; we present the basic theory underlying all regression models that we developed in our GUI. We also show how to implement these models using R software, carry out some applications to highlight the potential of Bayesian regression, and have theory and computational exercises.

**About me:** My name is Andrés Ramírez-Hassan, I am an applied and theory econometrician working as a Professor in the Department of Economics at Universidad EAFIT (Medellín, Colombia). I got a PhD in statistical science, two masters degrees, one in finance and another in economics, and also a bachelor’s degree in Economics. In addition, I was a research fellow at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University, and a visiting professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne. Having completed my PhD degree, much of my research has been in the area of Bayesian Econometrics with applications in finance, utilities, health, crime and sports. My work has been published  (or is forthcoming) in the *International Journal of Forecasting, Journal of Applied Econometrics, Econometric Reviews, Economic Modelling, Spatial Economic Analysis, Economic Inquiry, World Development, Journal of Sport Economics, Empirical Economics, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics*, and other highly regarded international research outlets.

I founded **BEsmarter --Bayesian Econometrics: simulations, models and applications to research, teaching and encoding with responsibility--**. This is a research group whose **mission** is to lead and excel in the generation and dissemination of Bayesian Econometric knowledge through research, teaching and software. We en**vision** worldwide econometric research, teaching and applications based on a Bayesian framework that:

* Devises new econometric ideas

* Develops a user friendly environment for applications of Bayesian econometrics

* Transforms classic econometric research, teaching and applications

* And where one of the main concerns of science is to solve social problems.

# Preface {-}

The main goal of this book is to make more approachable the Bayesian econometric framework to people who want to know and apply this statistical approach, but who do not have time to develop programing skills. I try to have a balance between applicability and theory foundation. Then, this book comes with a very friendly Graphical User Interface to implement the most common econometric models, but also contains the basic mathematical developments, as well as their code implementation, for those who are interested in advancing in more complex models.
