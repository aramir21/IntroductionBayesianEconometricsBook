Since late 90’s Bayesian inference has gained a lot of popularity among researchers due to the computational revolution and availability of algorithms to solve complex integrals. However, many researchers, students and practitioners still lack understanding and application of this inferential approach. The main reason is the requirement of good programming skills.

**Introduction to Bayesian econometrics: A GUIded tour** mainly targets those who want to apply Bayesian regression analysis having a good conceptual and formal understanding, but not having time to develop programming skills. Thus, this book provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to carry out Bayesian regression in a very friendly environment. The book also provides the basic theory, and its code implementation using R software [@R2021], some econometric applications to highlight the potential of Bayesian regression, and theory and computational exercises, for those who are interested in developing more complex models.

Our GUI is based on an interactive web application using shiny [@Chang2018], and some libraries in R (see Table \@ref(tab:tabGUI) in the Appendix). Users can estimate univariate, multivariate, hierarchical, Bayesian bootstrap and Bayesian model average models using our GUI. In addition, it gives basic summaries and formal and graphical diagnostics of the posterior chains. Our GUI can be run in any operating system, and is freely available at [https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp](https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp). 

Users can get simulated and real datasets in the folders *DataSim* (see Table \@ref(tab:tabDataSim) for details), and *DataApp* (see Table \@ref(tab:tabDataApp) for details), respectively.
The former folder also includes the files that were used to simulate different processes, so, the population parameters are available, and as a consequence these files can be used as a pedagogical tool to show some statistical properties. The latter folder contains the datasets used in our applications. Users should use these datasets as templates to structuring their own datasets. Simply type **shiny::runGitHub("besmarter/BSTApp", launch.browser=T)** in the R package console or any R code editor to run our GUI.^[I strongly recommend to type the code line rather than copy and paste it.]

Chapter \@ref(basics) begings with an introduction to formal concepts in Bayesian inference starting with the Bayes’ rule, all its components with their formal definitions and basic examples. Then, it presents the basics of Bayesian inference based on decision theory under uncertainty. Chapter \@ref(bayfre) presents conceptual differences between Bayesian and Frequentist statistical approaches, and a historical and philosophical perspective about Bayesian statistics and econometrics highlighting differences compared to the frequentist approach. Chapter \@ref(objsub) presents the differences between the objective and subjective schools in Bayesian inference. Particular attention is put to elicitation techniques, that is, how to transform expert knowledge into prior probabilistic statements. In Chapter \@ref(conjfam) I introduce conjugate families in basic statistical models, solving them analytically and computationally. Simulation based methods are shown in Chapter \@ref(sim), these algorithms are very important in modern Bayesian inference as most realistic models do not have analytical solutions. Univariate and multivariate regression models are presented in chapters \@ref(unireg) and \@ref(multi), respectively. Chapter \@ref(time) presents the state-space representation of time series models, and Chapter \@ref(longi) presents Bayesian longitudinal models. In Chapter \@ref(diag) I show formal and graphical convergence diagnostics of posterior chains. Chapter \@ref(bma) introduces Bayesian model averaging, and Chapter \@ref(nonpara) shows some basics of Bayesian non-parametric models. Chapter \@ref(recent) describes some recent methodological developments such as variational Bayes (VB) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), and computational algorithms such as sequential Monte Carlo, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and population Monte Carlo.

**About me:** My name is Andrés Ramírez-Hassan, I am an applied and theory econometrician working as a Professor in the Department of Economics at Universidad EAFIT (Medellín, Colombia). I got a PhD in Statistical Science, a masters degree in Finance, and another in Economics, and also a bachelor’s degree in Economics. I was a research fellow at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University, and a visiting Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne. Having completed my PhD degree, much of my research has been in the area of Bayesian Econometrics with applications in finance, utilities, health, crime and sports. My work has been published  (or is forthcoming) in the *International Journal of Forecasting, Journal of Applied Econometrics, Econometric Reviews, Economic Modelling, Spatial Economic Analysis, Economic Inquiry, World Development, Journal of Sport Economics, Empirical Economics, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics, Mathematics and Financial Economics, Brazilian Journal of Probability and Statistics*, and other highly regarded international research outlets.

I founded **BEsmarter** --**B**ayesian **E**conometrics: **s**imulations, **m**odels and **a**pplications to **r**esearch, **t**eaching and **e**ncoding with **r**esponsibility--. This is a research group whose **mission** is to *lead and excel in the generation and dissemination of Bayesian Econometric knowledge through research, teaching and software*. We en**vision** *worldwide econometric research, teaching and applications based on a Bayesian framework that*:

* *Inspires new econometric ideas*

* *Creates a user friendly environment for applications of Bayesian econometrics*

* *Transforms classic econometric research, teaching and applications*

* *And where one of the main concerns of science is to solve social problems.*

# Preface {-}

The main goal of this book is to make more approachable the Bayesian econometric framework to students, researchers and practitioners who want to understand and apply this statistical/econometric approach, but who do not have time to develop programing skills. I tried to have a balance between applicability and theory. Then, this book comes with a very friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the most common econometric models, but also contains the basic mathematical developments, as well as their code implementation, for those who are interested in advancing in more complex models.

## To instructors and students {-}
The graphical user interface (GUI) can be download at [https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp](https://github.com/besmarter/BSTApp). Instructors and students can have all codes, simulated and real data sets there. To install our GUI just type **shiny::runGitHub("besmarter/BSTApp", launch.browser=T)** in the R package console or any R code editor, and execute it.

Students should have some basic knowledge in probability theory and statistics, particularly, regression analysis. It is strongly recommended to have some familiarity with standard univariate and multivariate probability distributions.

I included some formal and computational exercises at the end of each chapter. This would help students to have a better understanding of the material shown in each chapter. Solutions of exercises are available at [http://www.besmarter-team.org](http://www.besmarter-team.org).

Instructors can use this book as a text in a course of introduction to Bayesian Econometrics with a high emphasis on implementation and applications. This book is complentary, rather than substitute, of other excellent books in the topic ([@rossi2012bayesian],  [@greenberg2012introduction], [@geweke2005contemporary],   [@lancaster2004introduction] and [@koop2003bayesian]).

## Acknowledgments {-}

I started our GUI in the 2016 after being diagnosticed with cervical dystonia. I used to work in this side project on weekends, I named this time "nerd weekends", and it was a kind of release from my health condition. Once I got better, I invited Mateo Graciano, my former student, business partner and friend, to be part of the project, he helped me a lot developing our GUI, and I am enormously thankful to Mateo. I would also like to thank members of the BEsmarter research group from Universidad EAFIT, and NUMBATs members from Monash University for your comments and recomendations to improve our GUI.

This book is an extension of the paper **A GUIded tour of Bayesian regression** [@Ramirez2020], which is a brief user guide of our GUI. So, I decided to write this book to show the underlying theory and codes in our GUI, and use it as a text book in my course in Bayesian econometrics. I acknowledge and offer my gratitude to my students in this subject, their insight and thoughtful questions have helped me to get a better understanding of this material.   

I also thank Chris Parmeter for your suggestions about how to present our user guide, Professor Raul Pericchi and Juan Carlos Correa who introduced me to Bayesian statistics, Liana Jacobi and Chun Fung Kwok (Jackson) from the University of Melbourne and David Frazier from Monash University for nice talks and amazing colaborations in Bayesian Econometrics, Professor Peter Diggle to support my career, and particularly, Professor Gael Martin, who gave me a chance to work with her, she is an inspiring intellectual figure. Finally, my colleagues and staff from Universidad EAFIT have always given me their support.

To my parents, Orlando and Nancy, who have given me their unconditional support. They have taught me that the primary aspect of the human being's evolution is humility. Unfortunately, I have not learned very well their lesson, yet.
