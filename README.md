# IntroductionBayesianEconometricsBook
Introduction to Bayesian econometrics: A GUIded tour is aimed at those who want to apply Bayesian regression analysis having good theory understanding, but not having time to develop programming skills. This book provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to carry out Bayesian regression in a very friendly environment. This book is designed for teaching and applied purposes at an introductory level; we present the basic theory underlying all regression models that we developed in our GUI. We also show how to implement these models using R package, carry out some applications to highlight the potential of Bayesian regression, and have theory and computational exercises.
